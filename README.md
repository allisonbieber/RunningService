# RunningService
This repository is the backend service for my full stack Running App. The purpose of this application is to use APIs to obtain data from a 
local database, 'run' and load them into a table in order to analyze the data. This application uses Spring Boot and Java for the backend. This project is
currently in progress. 

# Database

The database, 'events' that I have created using MySQL represents a single 'run' event. The features are as follows: 
  * Miles (double) 
  * Elevation (double)
  * Hours (int)
  * Minutes (int)
  * Seconds (int)
  * Pace (double)
  * Relative Effort (int)
  * Average Heart Rate (int)
  * Max Speed (double)
  * Date (datetime)
